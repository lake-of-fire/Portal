// MARK: - Portal Configuration

/// Configuration levels for customizing portal layer views during animation.
///
/// This enum provides three levels of control over how the layer view is styled
/// and positioned during portal transitions:
///
/// - **Styling**: Modify appearance only; frame/offset applied automatically after
/// - **Full**: Complete control with interpolated size/position; must apply frame/offset yourself
/// - **Raw**: Access to both source and destination values for custom logic
public enum PortalConfiguration: Sendable {
    /// Level 1: Styling only configuration.
    ///
    /// Modify the layer view's appearance (clips, shadows, etc.) without affecting positioning.
    /// Frame and offset are applied automatically AFTER your configuration.
    ///
    /// **Parameters:**
    /// - `content`: The layer view to style
    /// - `isActive`: `true` when animating toward destination, `false` when at/toward source
    ///
    /// **Example:**
    /// ```swift
    /// .styling { content, isActive in
    ///     content
    ///         .clipShape(.rect(cornerRadius: isActive ? 20 : 10))
    ///         .shadow(radius: isActive ? 10 : 2)
    /// }
    /// ```
    case styling(@Sendable (AnyView, Bool) -> AnyView)

    /// Level 2: Full control with interpolated values.
    ///
    /// You have complete control over the layer view including positioning.
    /// You MUST apply frame and offset yourself using the provided values.
    ///
    /// **Parameters:**
    /// - `content`: The layer view to configure
    /// - `isActive`: `true` when animating toward destination, `false` when at/toward source
    /// - `size`: Interpolated size (destination when active, source otherwise)
    /// - `position`: Interpolated position (destination origin when active, source origin otherwise)
    ///
    /// **Example:**
    /// ```swift
    /// .full { content, isActive, size, position in
    ///     content
    ///         .frame(width: size.width, height: size.height)
    ///         .clipShape(.rect(cornerRadius: isActive ? 20 : 10))
    ///         .offset(x: position.x, y: position.y)
    /// }
    /// ```

    /// Level 3: Raw source and destination values.
    ///
    /// Access both source AND destination sizes and positions for custom interpolation
    /// or complex animation logic. You MUST apply frame and offset yourself.
    ///
    /// **Parameters:**
    /// - `content`: The layer view to configure
    /// - `isActive`: `true` when animating toward destination, `false` when at/toward source
    /// - `sourceSize`: Size of the source view
    /// - `destinationSize`: Size of the destination view
    /// - `sourcePosition`: Position (origin) of the source view
    /// - `destinationPosition`: Position (origin) of the destination view
    ///
    /// **Example:**
    /// ```swift
    /// .raw { content, isActive, sourceSize, destinationSize, sourcePosition, destinationPosition in
    ///     let size = isActive ? destinationSize : sourceSize
    ///     let position = isActive ? destinationPosition : sourcePosition
    ///     return content
    ///         .frame(width: size.width, height: size.height)
